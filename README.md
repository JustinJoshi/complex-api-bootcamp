Optimizations


I really enjoy working with apis. Apis are a lot of fun and its always enjoyable to manipulate data coming from fetch requests. However this time around,  my creativity felt really stunted. Leon mentioned we should make a project that "looks good" and put time into these. But i really couldnt think of ideas that i resonated with that i could achieve in a reasonable time frame. So i ended up having to settle with finding whatever APi that actually works and making something that completes the assignment. Reading through documentation can be fun sometimes, especially when its something youre passionate about. This week, i just wanted to complete the assignment and help everybody make sure they completed theirs too. I had a lot of fun helping people with their assignments this week.

Lessons Learned:
I learn that i cant always have creative ideas. It felt better for me to help others than work on my own projects!
